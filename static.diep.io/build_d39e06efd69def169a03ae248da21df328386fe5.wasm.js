Link for a file i found while poking around with inspect element
It seems to be written in webassembly so we would need to decompile it
It might be helpful idk what it is tho.
I suspect it may be part of the server however due to build in the title and the hexadecimal thing might be a build version/id?
prehaps it is simply part of the client
